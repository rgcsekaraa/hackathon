# User Stories

This document outlines the core user stories that drove the design and development of Sophiie Space.

## Authentication and Onboarding

- As a new user, I want to create an account easily so that I can start managing my workspace.
- As a returning user, I want to log in securely to access my saved data and preferences.
- As a user, I want a professional and inviting landing experience that clearly communicates the application's value.

## Workspace Management

- As a project manager, I want a high-density dashboard that allows me to see all my active tasks and projects at a glance.
- As a busy professional, I want my workspace to sync in real-time across my devices so that I never lose progress.
- As a user, I want to easily organize my tasks into folders (Work, Personal, Hackathon) for better clarity.

## AI Interaction

- As a user, I want to interact with my workspace using natural voice commands so that I can capture ideas while multi-tasking.
- As a developer, I want an AI assistant that understands the context of my current workspace to provide relevant help.
- As a user, I want to see visual feedback when the AI is "thinking" or "processing" my requests.

## Design and Accessibility

- As a power user, I want a clean, Material Design 3 interface that follows modern standards and feels premium.
- As a user who works at night, I want a dark mode option that is easy on the eyes.
